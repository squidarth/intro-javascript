Intro to Javascript
================

*Quick intro to Javascript*


### Where does client-side programming fit into a web app?

* We distinguish between "server-side" programming and "client-side" programming.
* The Python code we've written so far is server-side code, and is centralized.  All users interact with the same Python application
* Client-side applications run on individual users' devices.  This could take the form of:
  * iPhones
  * Androids
  * Blackberrys (lol)
  * Web browsers!
* Web browser applications are written in Javascript

### Why would we want to do this at all?

* Right now, we know how to make static pages with HTML/CSS
* We can accomplish a lot with just these
* But...changing the page requires a page refresh
* This feels slow, it doesn't feel like a nice native experience like what you get with Spotify, iTunes, etc.
* Javascript can give your app a native feel
  * Think Facebook chat, twitter, asana, etc.

### What are the difficult concepts to learn

* Unlike the Python programming you might have done, Javascript programming is UI programming
* Highly asynchronous/event-driven
* Can make the code seem complicated!

### I read on hacker news that you can write with only Javascript

* I don't want to complicate this too much, but Javascript is in many places now, not just web browser programming
* There's a way to run javascript on your computer via a framework called `node.js`
